        <p>
            A judge can make decisions based only on the information presented 
            by the parties as evidence. Your evidence includes your application, 
            any additional affidavit, and spoken evidence provided in court.
        </p> 

        <p>
            If you have a lawyer, they will come to court with you and assist 
            during the hearing.
        </p>

        <p>    
            If you do not have a lawyer, you may find it helpful to bring a 
            trusted friend or family member with you to provide emotional support, 
            take notes, and organize documents during your court appearance. 
            The Provincial Court has adopted

                Support Person Guidelines
            </a> that explain when you are permitted to have a support person help you, 
            and what they can do.

            If you are attending at the courthouse in person for your court 
            appearance,

                make a safety plan
            </a>. If the other party is also attending, 
            they will probably be close by. You can talk to a sheriff as part of 
            your safety planning. The sheriffâ€™s office is available by phone.
