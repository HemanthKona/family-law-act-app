A party cannot personally serve a document on the other party.</br></br>Some documents must be personally served, like the Application About a Family Law Matter and the Application About a Protection Order.</br></br>Ordinary service means that a party must be served to their address for service in one of the following ways:<ul><li>by leaving the documents at the party’s address for service</li><li>by mailing the documents by ordinary mail to the party’s address for service</li><li>by mailing the documents by registered mail to the party’s address for service</li><li>if the party’s address for service includes an email address, by emailing the documents to that email address</li><li>if the party’s address for service includes a fax number, by faxing the documents to that fax number</li></ul>A party’s address for service is the address they have provided to the court. A party who does not have an address for service must be served by personal service.</br></br>A person who is not a party can be served by leaving the documents with the person or by mailing them to the other person by ordinary mail to the person’s postal address. A document served by ordinary mail is considered served on the 14th day after it is mailed. This means you need at least 21 days to your court appearance to make sure they are served properly if you serve them by ordinary mail.<br><br>The rules about service are found in Part 12 <a href='https://www.bclaws.gov.bc.ca/civix/document/id/complete/statreg/120_2020#division_d1e12125' target='blank'>Division 4</a> of the Provincial Court Family Rules."
