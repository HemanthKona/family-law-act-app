         "description": "Normally, you need to give notice to the other party that you are applying for a court order. You give notice to the other party by having a copy of the application and supporting documents served on them at least 7 days before the date set for the court appearance unless the court allows the application to be made without notice or with less than 7 days' notice.</br></br>A judge can decide to review your application about a priority parenting matter without the other party being given notice if:<ul><li>it is unreasonable because of special circumstances, or</li><li>providing notice in advance would probably have serious consequences.</li></ul>A judge can also decide to change the amount of notice you give the other party. A judge may order that you can give the other party less than 7 days’ notice if they believe your situation requires a court order sooner than 7 days.  If this happens, remember that notice must still be given to the other party before a judge will hear the application.</br></br>You must ask a judge for permission to apply without notice to the other party or with less than 7 days’ notice.",

A party who does not have an address for service must be served by personal service.</br></br>The rules about service are found in Part 12 <a href='https://www.bclaws.gov.bc.ca/civix/document/id/complete/statreg/120_2020#division_d1e12125' target='blank'>Division 4</a> of the Provincial Court Family Rules.</br></br>Depending on how the documents are served, what day of the week they are served on, and even what time of day they are served, it might change how you count the notice period. Be sure to review the rules about service before serving the other party to make sure you give them proper notice."
