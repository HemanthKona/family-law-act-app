If they consent, it can save you time and energy. If they do agree to the case management order, you can choose to either:<ul><li>prepare the <a href='https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/law-crime-and-justice/courthouse-services/court-files-records/court-forms/family/pfa739.pdf?forcedownload=true' target='blank'>Consent Order Form 18</a>, or</li><li>go to a court appearance</li></ul>",
