      "description": "If you have filed an Application About a Family Law Matter, reply or counter application with the court and you no longer want to have the court make a decision about it, you can file a Notice of Removal of Lawyer for Party to stop it from continuing before the court.<br><br>If an application, reply or counter application is discontinued, it means that it has been abandoned. The party or the court cannot take any further action on the application or counter application but it does not cancel anything that has already been done in court.<br><br>You can only discontinue your own application, reply or counter application. If the other party has their own application, reply or counter application, it is not affected. This means you may still have to go to court about their document. If the other party also wants to discontinue their application, reply or counter application, they must also complete a Notice of Removal of Lawyer for Party.",
