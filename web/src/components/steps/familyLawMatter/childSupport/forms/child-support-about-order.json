      "description":"Usually the court orders an amount of child support based on the <a href='https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-97-175/index.html'  target='_blank'>Federal Child Support Guidelines</a>. This amount is called the guideline table amount and is meant to cover regular expenses like clothes, food and housing.<br><br>The court can order an amount other than the guideline table amount in certain situations, such as:<ul><li>when a child is 19 or older</li><li>when the parent paying support has an income over $150,000</li><li>when parents split or share parenting time</li><li>when there is undue hardship</li></ul> The next series of questions will help inform the factors that are important for calculating child support for your family situation.",
