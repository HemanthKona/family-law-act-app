It is different from child support.<br>A person is only entitled to spousal support in certain situations.  It is not a right in every case.  There are rules under the <a href=\"https://www.bclaws.gov.bc.ca/civix/document/id/lc/statreg/11025_00\" target=\"_blank\"> Family Law Act </a>about what makes you a spouse and when you can ask for an order for spousal support.<br>You can apply for spousal support if:<br><ul><li>you are a spouse because:</li><li>You were married</li><li>You lived together in a marriage-like relationship for at least two years, or</li><li>You lived in a marriage-like relationship for less than two years, but you have a child together</li><li>you can prove entitlement to the court for spousal support, and</li><li>you are applying in time (Married spouses must start a court proceeding claiming spousal support within two years of the date of their divorce or an order annulling their marriage. Unmarried spouses must start a court proceeding within two years of the date of their separation).</li></ul>",
