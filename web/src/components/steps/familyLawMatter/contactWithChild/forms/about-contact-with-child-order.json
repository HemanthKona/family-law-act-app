Usually, a child’s parent is also the child’s guardian. A parent is a child’s guardian if:<ul><li>they lived with the other parent when the child was born,</li><li>they care for the child regularly, but do not live with the child, or</li><li>in an assisted reproduction situation, they are named as a parent in a pre-conception agreement, and</li><li>there is no agreement or order that says they are not a guardian.</li></ul><br>A parent can become a guardian of a child through a court order or by an agreement with all the other guardians of the child. A non-parent can become a guardian through a court order.<br><br>Children often have important relationships with people other than their parents. These include grandparents, elders, relatives, and others close to the child. Usually these relationships are supported by the parents or guardians.<br><br>If an agreement is not possible, the person who believes they should have contact with the child can apply for a court order. The court will make a decision about contact with the child based on the best interests of the child.",
