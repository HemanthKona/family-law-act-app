            <div style="margin:0;">
                You must file at the <a target="_blank" href="https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content?id=5AD9441AEBD9428FA6EF86D6B1E39E96">Provincial Court Registry</a> :

                The registry clerk will review your package to make sure it is complete before filing it. You will be given a copy for your records.

            <p>    
                There are no fees for filing Provincial Court family documents.

            <div style="margin:0rem 0 0 0; display:inline;">

            <div style="margin:0;">
                Normally, each other party named in the Application About a Family Law Matter must be given a copy of the following documents by personal service:
            </div>
            <ul>
              <li>the Application About a Family Law Matter;</li>
              <li>instructions about how to file a reply and obtaining Form 6 for filing a reply, and;</li>
              <li>any other documents you filed with the Application About a Family Law Matter, including a Financial Statement if applicable.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                Personal service requires that an adult (at least 19 years old) who is not a party hand-deliver the documents to the party to be served.
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>Note:</b> If your application is to change, cancel, set aside or replace a written agreement about child support or spousal support that is filed with the Director of Maintenance Enforcement, you must serve a copy of the application on the director. The Director of Maintenance Enforcement can be served by mailing the documents to the postal address provided by the director. Contact the Family Maintenance Enforcement Program to find out how best to serve them.
            </p>

            <p>
                The court may need proof you had the documents personally served. The person serving the documents must complete a <a target="_blank" href="https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/law-crime-and-justice/courthouse-services/court-files-records/court-forms/family/pfa714.pdf">Certificate of Service</a> Form 7 so that you can prove personal service of the document. You must attach a copy of the documents to the Certificate of Service. Remember to make a copy before the documents are served.
            </p>

<!-- <Step 4> -->
        <div>
            <div style="margin:0rem 0 0 0; display:inline;">
                <check-box

            <p>
                The other party has 30 days from the date they are served to file their reply.<br/>            
                If the other party files a reply, the court registry will provide you with a copy of the reply along with instructions on how to schedule your family management conference. Your first step with the court will be to attend a family management conference.
            </p>
            <div style="margin:0;">
                If the other party does not file a reply within 30 days of them being served, you can take steps to have your case heard by the court without the other party. You can schedule the family management conference by:
            </div>
            <ul>
                <li>filing the Certificate of Service</li>
                <li>following the scheduling instructions provided by the court registry</li>
            </ul>
           
            <p>
                <b>Note:</b> You will need to be ready to provide your file number, the names of the parties in your case, your name, and your availability to attend court.
            </p>

            <p>
                If you have a lawyer, they will help with scheduling your case for a date you can attend.
            </p>

<!-- <Step 5> -->
        <div>
             <div style="margin:0rem 0 0 0; display:inline;">

                    style="display:inline; margin:0 0.5rem 0 0; font-weight: 600;" 
                    check=""

            </div>  
            
            <div style="margin:0;">
                A family management conference is an informal and time-limited process in which a judge or family justice manager:
            </div>
            <ul>
                <li>assists the parties to identify the issues to be resolved</li>
                <li>explores options to resolve the issues</li>
                <li>can make case management orders or directions to make sure your case is ready for the next step</li>
                <li>can make interim (temporary) orders about your family law matters</li>
                <li>can make an order by consent of the parties</li>
                <li>can make an order without a party, if a party does not show up or file a reply</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                Your scheduling notice will provide you with more information about what happens at the family management conference.
