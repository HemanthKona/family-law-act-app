        <div style="font-size:14pt;font-weight:600; margin-bottom:1rem;">CHECKLIST FOR APPLICATION ABOUT A PROTECTION ORDER</div>

<!-- <Step 1> -->
        <div>
            <b>Step 1: Complete the Application about a Protection Order form</b>
        </div>

        <div class="mt-2"></div>

<!-- <Step 2> -->
        <div>
            <b>Step 2: Determine if you should apply without notice</b>
            <p class="mb-2">
                You normally need to give notice to the other party that you are applying for a court order. You give notice to the other party by having the application documents personally served on them.
            </p>
            <div style="margin:0;">
                Under some circumstances, an application about a protection order may be made without notice to the other party. For example, it may not be reasonable to give the other person notice (serve them with a copy of the application documents) before the application is heard by the court if:
            </div>
            <ul>
               <li>you or your children are in imminent danger of harm; or</li>
               <li>providing notice in advance would probably have serious consequences.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="mb-2">
                If you are making an application about a protection order without notice, you will have to satisfy the court that there is a real risk of some danger or serious consequence if notice were required before your order is made. If you apply for an order without notice, the
                application will be heard right away. The judge will decide if the order can be made without notice, if notice must be given, or if the notice period should be shortened. The time between the day that a party is served and the day that the application is heard is called 
                the “notice period” or “notice”. Normally, the other party must be served with at least 7 days’ notice of the court appearance. A judge can also allow for an application to be served with less than 7 days’ notice.
            </p>
           
        </div>
        <div class="mt-2"></div>
<!-- <Step 3> -->
        <div>
            <b>Step 3: If applicable, get the Schedule 1 affidavit sworn/affirmed and signed with a commissioner for taking affidavits</b>
            
            <p class="mb-2">
                The Schedule 1 Affidavit must be signed with a commissioner for taking affidavits. They will need to see your photo ID and they will ask you to promise that the information in the application affidavit is true.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-2">
                Lawyers and notaries are all commissioners for taking affidavits. The court registry also has staff who are commissioners for taking affidavits who can swear or affirm your affidavit for free.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-2">
                If you cannot get the document sworn or affirmed before the document is filed, the unsworn document can be filed if you will be available to swear or affirm that the contents of the document are true during your court appearance.
            </p>

        </div>
        <div class="mt-2"></div>
<!-- <Step 4> -->
        <div>
            <b>Step 4: File your application and any supporting materials</b>

            <div style="margin:0;">
                You must file at the <a target="_blank" href="https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content?id=5AD9441AEBD9428FA6EF86D6B1E39E96">Provincial Court Registry</a> :
            </div>
            <ul>
                <li>where the existing Provincial Court case with the same parties is filed</li>
               <li>nearest to where you or the other person who needs protection lives, or</li>
               <li>nearest to where the child(ren) ordinarily live, if you fear for the safety of your children or there are children named in an existing protection order.</li>            
            </ul>
           
            <p class="mb-2">
                If your situation is urgent and you need to file the application about a protection order in another location, the court can give you permission to file the application 
                at any <a target="_blank" href="https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content?id=5AD9441AEBD9428FA6EF86D6B1E39E96">Provincial Court Registry</a> in the province. 
                You can ask for permission using the <a target="_blank" href="https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/download/D6B5BF5B2ECB46B08BBC54808F4F7BB1">Application for Case Management Order Without Notice or Attendance</a> Form 11.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-2">
                The registry clerk will review your package to make sure it is complete before filing it. You will be given a copy for your records.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-2">
                The registry will work with you to schedule a date for the court appearance. If you are making your application without notice and it is urgent, be prepared to wait at the courthouse after filing your application for your court appearance. Depending on the day, it can take some time to find an available judge and get you before the court, but they will make sure your application is heard as soon as possible.
                There are no court fees for filing Provincial Court family documents.

<!-- <Step 5> -->
        <div>
            <b>Step 5: Unless you are making your application without notice to the other party, arrange for personal service of the Application About a Protection Order on each other party</b>
            
            <p class="mb-2">
                Service is the act of giving or leaving documents with the required person. It is important that each other party know that a case is going on, are aware of what step is being taken, and are given a chance to tell their side of the story to the court.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-2">
                You must arrange to have the other party personally served a copy of the documents with at least 7 days' notice of the date and time of the court appearance, unless the court has ordered something else. This means there must be at least 7 days between the date the documents are served on the other party and the date and time of the court appearance.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-2">
                An adult (at least 19 years old), who is not a party to the case, must personally serve the application about a protection order by hand- delivering a copy of the application to the other party.
            </p>

            <p class="mb-2">
                You may ask a friend, family member, or other adult person to personally serve the documents for you. You can also hire a person, called a process server, to serve the documents for you. Process servers are experienced in finding and serving people. To find a process server, search the Internet or look in the yellow pages.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-2">
                The court may need proof you had the documents personally served. The person serving the documents must complete a <a target="_blank" href='https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/download/7F83FBAF566D4442AA69427E2D50FFA7'>Certificate of Service</a> Form 7 so that you can prove personal service of the documents took place. You must attach a copy of the documents to the Certificate of Service. Remember to make a copy before the documents are served.
            </p>

        <div class="mt-2"></div>
<!-- <Step 6> -->
        <div>
            <b>Step 6: Attend the Court Appearance</b>
            <p class="mb-2">
                A judge can make decisions based only on the information presented by the parties as evidence. Your evidence includes your application, any additional affidavit, and spoken evidence provided in court.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-2">
                If you have a lawyer, they will come to court with you and assist during the hearing.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-2">
                If you do not have a lawyer, you may find it helpful to bring a trusted friend or family member with you to provide emotional support, take notes, and organize documents during your court appearance.  
                The Provincial Court has adopted <a target="_blank" href='https://www.provincialcourt.bc.ca/downloads/Practice%20Directions/Support%20Person%20Guidelines.pdf'>Support Person Guidelines</a> that explain when you are permitted to have a support person help you, and what they can do.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-2">
                If you are attending at the courthouse in person for your court appearance, make a safety plan. If the other party is also attending, they will probably be close by. You can talk to a sheriff as part of your safety planning. The sheriff’s office is available by phone. For contact information visit Courthouse Locations on the BC Government website at <a target="_blank" href="https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content?id=5AD9441AEBD9428FA6EF86D6B1E39E96">www.gov.bc.ca</a>.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-2">
                Your safety plan should include going to and from the courthouse.
            </p>
            <b>Once a protection order is made</b>
            <p class="mb-2">
                An order takes effect at the time it is made unless ordered otherwise. That means that the person identified in the protection order must follow the conditions of the order from the moment the judge makes the order in court.
            </p>                
            <p class="mb-2">
                Registry staff are usually responsible for drafting the protection order and getting it signed by the judge. The registry will then provide a copy to you, any other party who attended the court appearance, and the Protection Order Registry. The Protection Order Registry keeps a record of all protection orders. Police officers can contact them to check if a protection order is in place and get a copy of the order.
            </p>                
            <p class="mb-2">
                It is important for the person identified in the protection order to know that there is a protection order in place and what they must do or not do. If they were not in court when the order was made, the order must be personally served on them so they are aware of it. Registry staff will help to facilitate personal service of the protection order on the other party if they are in British Columbia. There is no fee for this service. If they are outside BC, you will need to arrange for them to be served.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-2">
                To facilitate service, you must provide the registry with information about where the person may be found. To do this, you must complete a Request for Service of Family Protection Order form and give it to the registry.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-2">
                Once the protection order has been served, a copy of the proof of service will be sent to the Protection Order Registry.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-2">
                A police officer may take action to enforce a protection order whether or not there is proof that the order has been served on the person. If a protection order is not being followed, the police can enforce it under the Criminal Code. Call 911 for help.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-2">
                A protection order will expire on the date a judge orders for it to end. If the judge doesn’t order a specific end date, it expires one year after the date it is made.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-2">
                There is no limit on protection order applications. Another application can be made if an application was denied, the terms of an order need to be changed, or an order has expired and another one is needed.
            </p>
