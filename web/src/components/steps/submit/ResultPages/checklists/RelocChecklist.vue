            <p style="margin:0.5rem 0 0.5rem 0;">
                Service is the act of giving or leaving documents with the required person. It is important that each 
                other party know that a case is going on, are aware of what step is being taken, and are given a 
                chance to tell their side of the story to the court.
            </p>

            <p style="margin:0 0 0.5rem 0;">
                You must serve the other party with at least 7 days' notice of the date and time of the court appearance, 
                unless the court has ordered something else. This means there must be at least 7 days between the date 
                the application is served on the other party and the date and time of the court appearance.
            </p>
            
            <div style="margin:0 0 0.5rem 0;">
                An Application for Order Prohibiting the Relocation of a Child must be served to the address of 
                service of each other party in any of the following ways:
            </div>
            <ul>
                <li>by leaving the documents at the party’s address for service</li>
                <li>by mailing the documents by ordinary mail to the party’s address for service</li>
                <li>by mailing the documents by registered mail to the party’s address for service</li>
                <li>
                    if the party’s address for service includes an email address, by emailing the 
                    documents to that email address                  
                </li>
                <li>
                    if the party’s address for service includes a fax number, by faxing the 
                    documents to that fax number                  
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                A party's address for service is the address they have provided to the court. A party 
                who does not have an address for service must be served by leaving a copy of the 
                documents directly with the person (this is called personal service).
            </p>

            <p>
                Personal service requires that an adult (at least 19 years old) who is not a party 
                hand deliver the documents to the party to be served.
            </p>

            <p>
                The court may need proof you had the documents personally served. The person serving 
                the documents must complete a 
                <a 
                    target="_blank"

                    Certificate of Service
                </a> Form 7 so that you can prove personal service of the documents. You must attach 
                a copy of the documents to the Certificate of Service. Remember to make a copy 
                before the documents are served.

                A judge can make decisions based only on the information presented by the parties 
                as evidence. Your evidence includes your application, any additional affidavit(s), 
                and spoken evidence provided in court.

                the court’s permission to attend using a different method of
