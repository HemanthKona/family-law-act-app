            <div style="margin:0 0 0.5rem 0;">
                Depending on the last step that was taken, there are different ways you 
                must give a copy to each other party.
            </div>            
            
            <div style="margin:0 0 0.5rem 0;">                
                If the last step taken was the filing of the Application About a Family 
                Law Matter or any other step following the filing the Application, including 
                the filing of an Application to Obtain an Order, Application Respecting Existing 
                Orders or Agreements or Notice of Motion and no final order has been made, you 
                must serve each other party with a copy of the Notice of Intention to Proceed, 
                and previously filed and served application, in any of the following ways:
            </div>
            <ul>
                <li>by leaving the documents at the party’s address for service</li>
                <li>by mailing the documents by ordinary mail to the party’s address for service</li>
                <li>by mailing the documents by registered mail to the party’s address for service</li>
                <li>
                    if the party’s address for service includes an email address, by emailing the 
                    documents to that email address                  
                </li>
                <li>
                    if the party’s address for service includes a fax number, by faxing the 
                    documents to that fax number                  
                </li>
            </ul>  
            
            <p>
                If the filed application has not been previously served, it must be served 
                by personal service. In this case, the Notice of Intention to Proceed may 
                also be served personally together with the previously filed application.
            </p>

            <p>
                A party’s address for service is the address they have provided to the court. 
                If a party does not have an address for service, the application must be 
                served by personal service.
            </p>
            <p>
                Personal service requires that an adult (at least 19 years old) who is not 
                a party hand-deliver the documents to the party to be served.
            </p>

            <p>
                The court will need proof you had the documents served. The person serving the 
                documents must complete a  
                <a 
                    target="_blank" 
                    href="https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/law-crime-and-justice/courthouse-services/court-files-records/court-forms/family/pfa714.pdf">
                    Certificate of Service Form 7
                </a> so that you can prove service of the documents. You must attach a copy of 
                the documents to the Certificate of Service. Remember to make a copy before the 
                documents are served.
            </p>

            <div style="margin:0 0 0.5rem 0;">                
                If your case is filed in an early resolution registry and the last step 
                taken was the filing of the Notice to Resolve a Family Law Matter, 
                participation in a needs assessment, completion of a parenting education 
                program or participation in consensual dispute resolution, you can give 
                each other party a copy of the Notice of Intention to Proceed, and Notice 
                to Resolve a Family Law Matter if not already provided, using any way you 
                believe will get it to them, including:
            </div>
            <ul>
                <li>giving them a copy in person</li>
                <li>sending a copy by email, text message, instant message, or mail</li>
                <li>getting a friend or someone else to give them a copy</li>              
            </ul>  

        </div>

            <div style="margin:0 0 0.5rem 0;">                
                Before proceeding any further with your court case, you must either:
            </div>
            <ul>
                <li>participate in a needs assessment, or</li>
                <li>attend a family management conference</li>               
            </ul>  
            
            <p>
                The next step you must take to proceed with your case will depend 
                on what the last step taken in your case was. At the needs assessment 
                or family management conference, the needs assessor or judge will be 
                able to determine where your case is at and what the most appropriate 
                next step.
            </p>            

            <div style="margin:0 0 0.5rem 0;">

                    days has passed since the application was served and, if at
