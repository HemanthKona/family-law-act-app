            Lawyers and notaries are all commissioners for taking affidavits. The court registry

            your affidavit for free.

            <div style="margin:0 0 0.5rem 0;">
                The registry clerk will review your package to make sure it is complete before

                Service is the act of giving or leaving documents with the required person. 
                You must serve a copy of the financial statement on each other party. 
                If you are filing your financial statement:

            <ul>
                <li>with your Application About a Family Law Matter, it is served along with the application</li>
                <li>
                    with your Reply to a Family Law Matter, the registry will give a copy to the other 
                    party. This counts as you serving it on them.
                </li>
                <li>in any other circumstance, it must be served on the other party to their address for service</li>
            </ul>           

            <p>
                Unless the registry serves it, the court may need proof the documents were served. 
                The person serving the document(s) must complete a
