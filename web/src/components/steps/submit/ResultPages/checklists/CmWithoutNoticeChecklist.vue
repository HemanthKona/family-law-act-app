                Depending on what you are requesting on your application, it may take the

                you know when you can expect to hear from them. If you have provided an 
                email address in your address for service, they can usually let you know 
                the results of your application by email.

                The order must be served to the address for service of each other party

                Note: If your application was made to allow service of a document using an alternative 
                method, the order can be served along with the document using the method ordered by 
                the judge.
